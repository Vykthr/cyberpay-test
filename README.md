# CyberPay Test APP

This project is a test web application with the intention to test my conversion of figma designs to a React Web APP.
Due to time constraint, i was unable to implement a mobile view, so this web app is not screen responsive.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
